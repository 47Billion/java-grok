## What is Grok?
Java Grok is simple tool that allows you to easily parse logs and other files (single line). With Java Grok, you can turn unstructured log and event data into structured data (JSON).

Java Grok program is a great tool for parsing log data and program output. You can match any number of complex patterns on any number of inputs (processes and files) and have custom reactions.

### What can I use Grok for?
* reporting errors and other patterns from logs and processes
* parsing complex text output and converting it to json for external processing
* apply 'write-once use-everywhere' to regular expressions
* automatically providing patterns for unknown text inputs (logs you want patterns generated for future matching)
